			<p>Year: Summer 2015<br>Role: Producer/Programmer<br>Teammates: Hazel Anderson, Theresa Tran, Kaia Hudson, Frances Wall</p>
			
			<p>Feral was a top-down RPG developed in three weeks using Stencyl as part of the Girls Make Games initiative, a series of international summer camps, workshops and game jams designed to inspire young girls to get into coding and game development. Feral features Mochi, a housecat who has recently been abandoned by his owners. She must learn how to survive in the forest by earning the respect of other feral cats.</p>
			
			<p>As one of the camp counselors for the San Francisco camp, I helped a team of four girls develop one of their first games and present it to their parents with the help of some professional guest artists and musicians. I had a lot of fun teaching them about game development and helping them turn their ideas into working code and logic, but I also had to make sure their game ideas were scoped properly for the short work period.</p>
			
			<p>All 36 of the camps' games were reviewed by industry professionals, and Feral managed to make top 5! You can find out more about the Girls Make Games camps at <a href="http://girlsmakegames.com/">girlsmakegames.com</a>, and Stencyl at <a href="http://stencyl.com/">stencyl.com</a></p>

			<p><b>Don't forget to download and play the game below for the complete experience!</b></p>

			<p>(Note: Stencyl uses a significantly older version of Adobe Flash Player that makes it a bit more difficult to open in a browser. If you can, make sure to try using the desktop version of the Flash Player. This is much easier with Macs than Windows computers.</p>

			<p>There is also an unresolved bug with the Resources Used button that forces you to restart the game. Sorry!)</p>
