			<p>I'm a student game designer and developer from Southern California. I deeply enjoy competitive gaming experiences and hope to be able to work on them in the future, but I am currently exploring as much of the gaming industry as I can.</p>

			<h1>User Research</h1>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/userInterviews.png">
				<h4>User Interviews</h4>
				<p>In order to find out more about what my users would want from a professional portfolio, I interviewed several students who had their own portfolios about what their career goals were, what they might expect hirers to be looking for, and what the purpose of their portfolios was (e.g. for showing games? Art? Sound? Code?)</p>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/competitorAnalysis.png">
				<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
				<p>In order to learn more about what game developers might present on a portfolio, I looked up several websites from industry professionals, alumni, and my colleagues in order to review them (taking particular interest in people who had already been hired). This helped me learn about their sites' strengths and weaknesses, as well as giving me some ideas for core features.However, many of the websites I reviewed proved to be somewhat old and not mobile-friendly as a result.</p>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/featureValueMatrix.png">
				<h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
				<p>Once I had gotten a grasp of what other portfolio websites might have, I summarized what the core features that I felt my website needed, and evaluate them based on how useful they would be for the site's audience and how much technical effort it would take to implement them. Ultimately, I realized that one of the most difficult features would be a blog since it has to have continually updated content in order to provide real value.Most other features were what I already had in mind for portfolio websites.</p>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/featurePrioritization.png">
				<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
				<p>With all my core features planned and rated, I placed them on two kinds of prioritization charts in order to clearly see what features I should implement first, and what could go on the backburner. This prioritization also helped me understand what features I needed to stand out in my interface- contact information and a resume, for example, should be immediately accessible.</p>

			<h1>User Testing</h1>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/userStories.png">
				<h4>User Stories</h4>
				<p>Making user stories is essential to software development of any sort since it allows you to clearly see what features your users need in short, simple, and most importantly, actionable statements. My core users were hiring managers and other colleagues, so I tried to think about what their needs were based off of prior knowledge and my user interviews.</p>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/cognitiveWalkthrough.png">
				<h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
				<p>After developing the prototype for my website, I had several test users from my field try to use my website in order to simulate how hiring managers and other users would navigate my website. It was critical for me to take note of their thought process and the gestures they made (especially any hesitation) so that I could iterate and build the clearest website possible.</p>

			<div class="game">
				<img src="images/Final/userTests.png">
				<h4>User Tests</h4>
				<p>In order to ensure that the results of my cognitive walkthroughs were not just by chance, I used a website to build some simple user tests based off of the tasks that I expected from my core audience. I made a question test to get a better understanding of the users' opinion on the website, and a click test to ensure that my users knew how to access whatever I needed them to. I got access to several users I had never met before through the site I used, UsabilityHub, and for the most part my tests had positive results.</p>

			<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
			<p>Overall, my site did prove to be successful in its core goals of advertising my career goals, my projects, and how to contact me. However, the users I tested consistently mentioned that the website looked drab and the minimalistic colors were boring for a game design website. They acknowledged the existence of several bugs, such as the images in my image gallery being too large and my text being stretched too far across the screen. They were also not immediately sure of how to contact me since I didn't have a specific button for it- the only button I had was my email icon.</p>
			<p>The material that I showed them for each project contained enough information for their needs, but without access to real hiring managers, it is difficult to say if there is actually enough info there. My users did not think that my site's lack of a blog was a problem, since they were aware that it would take a lot of effort to consistently update. Most of the tasks I had set for them to accomplish on my website were successfully achieved.The site is also easily navigable on mobile and tablet devices because of my use of responsive design.</p>

			<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
			<p>At this point, the most critical aspect of improving my website would be improving how it looks. I do not need to list more games on my website since this gives them a clear idea of what I've made without having too many or too few games. There are some small additions I could make, such as expanding my self-description and creating an easily visible Contact Me area as opposed to just having the email icon. I may also need to look into what other social media pages I would need to make in order to advertise my work better. I would like to clean up my code and the site's formatting (in terms of text padding, margins, etc.), but again, those are minor details. In attempting to fix my description area (my header), I have made it off-center, and have not been able to make it centered without disorganizing the rest of my site.</p>
			<p>I do need to fix the glitches involved with the image gallery and my nav menus, but since I'm preparing for finals I haven't been focused on finding out how to implement these changes. The attempts I've made in fixing these features have also proven unsuccessful since I am not as experienced with Javascript or CSS as some other web developers. I feel like I should conduct more user tests, especially with real hiring managers, in order to get a better idea of what else I would need to improve for my website since those are minor details as opposed to large, overarching design flaws.</p>
